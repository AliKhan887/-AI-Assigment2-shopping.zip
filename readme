Objective:
The main goal of this project was to build an AI that predicts if an online shopper will actually complete a purchase or just leave without buying. 
This is useful because if a website knows a user might not buy, they could show a discount code to encourage them.

Dataset: I used a CSV file containing thousands of user sessions with "evidence" columns like page duration, browser type, and bounce rates.
The most important part is the "Revenue" column, which is the label I used to train the model to distinguish between buyers and non-buyers.

Methodology: 
I implemented a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier (with k=1) using the `scikit-learn` library, which predicts intent by finding the most similar past user.
I also split the data into training and testing sets to fairly evaluate how well the model works on new data it hasn't seen before.

Results: 
True Positive Rate (Sensitivity): 37.84%
True Negative Rate (Specificity): 91.73%
